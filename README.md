## Reflection
> What could you have done differently during the planning stages of your project to make the execution easier?
Not use ritalin

> Were there any requirements that were difficult to implement? What do you think would make them easier to implement in future projects?
Html page, and by extention displaying stuff from the backend.    
Something to make them easier would be designing html pages earlier.

> What would you add to or change about your application if given more time?
More views to properly see the data.   

> Use this space to make notes for your future self about anything that you think is important to remember about this process or that may aid you when attempting something similar.   
Yeah just stick with adderall.
